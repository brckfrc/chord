# Chord Project Rules

## Language Rules

- All code comments must be written in English only
- No Turkish in comments, commit messages, or documentation
- No emojis in code comments
- Use Turkish only when directly conversing with the user

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Keep solutions simple and focused
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## Git Operations (CRITICAL)

- NEVER run git commands (add, commit, push, stash, merge, rebase) without explicit user approval
- Always show changes first (git diff) and ask: "Commit yapmamı ister misin?"
- Only proceed after receiving clear user confirmation

## File Editing

- NEVER add or remove trailing newlines at the end of files
- Preserve the original file ending format exactly as it is
- If old_string ends without newline, new_string must also end without newline
- If old_string ends with newline, new_string must also end with newline
